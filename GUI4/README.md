This is the 4th edition of my custom user interface, primarily for WoW Legion 7.1.5 - 7.3.5. 

Unlike its predecessors it is divided into several addons, each handling a different aspect of the UI. The core is required, while the rest are all completely optional, but work seemlessly with each other when installed.

## How to install

Clone or download and unzip this project, then move all the relevant subfolders (GUI4/gUI4, GUI4/gUI4_ActionBars, etc) to your **World of Warcraft\\Interface\\AddOns\\** directory. That's all there is to it!
