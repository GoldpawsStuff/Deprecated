# Deprecated AddOns
Old stuff for outdated versions of the WoW API, uploaded on user request.

Note that I won't answer questions about these, nor offer any sort of user support. I don't play private realms, I don't intend to start. These older versions are provided as reference and for those that might find them interesting, but I stopped working on all of them years ago. 

## How to install
Click the green button on this page, and download a zip file from there. Unzip it on your computer, and move the relevant folders to your addon location. If you got this far, you should be able to figure out the details of this too. If you're uncertain, remember that the addon folders are those that have a .toc file in them.

## Love it? Tip me!
Anything as little as a dollar is awesome. If everybody that ever used my addons paid a single dollar, I would be doing this as a fairly well paid full time job. As it happens, hardly anybody does, so I'm broke and practically homeless. So anything as little as a dollar is awesome! ;)
